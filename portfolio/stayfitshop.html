          <p>
            Made using SwiftUI, StayFitShop is a shopping application that
            enables users to browse and search products downloaded from the
            server and cached using Core Data Framework, add them to Cart,
            create their user profile and Checkout.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some of the tools and techniques I used:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>SwiftUI</li>
            <li>MVVM design pattern</li>
            <li>Core Data Framework</li>
            <li>Async/Await</li>
            <li>Swift Package Manager</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Views in this app are shown in a tab bar and navigation views within
            each tab. Products are downloaded once when the app first starts and
            saved to persistant storage using Core Data Framework. Images are
            cached as well using
            <a href="https://github.com/SDWebImage/SDWebImageSwiftUI"
              >SDWebImageSwiftUI</a
            >
            to lessen the network usage and increase performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each product can be added and removed from cart freely and the cart
            is being saved using Core Data. To manage data I used a Singleton in
            the CoreDataManager so I can access what I need from all over the
            app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users need to create their profile on checkout or use the dedicated
            tab "Profile" which is also saved using Core Data.
          </p>
          <p>Here is the app in action:</p>
          <div class="article__video-container">
            <video
              controls
              preload="none"
              poster="../img/stay-fit-shop/Latest.png"
              src="../img/stay-fit-shop/StayFitShopShowcase.mov"
            ></video>
          </div>
          <p>
            I tried my best to optimize the whole app and I am aware of some
            issues regarding memory (some views don't get deallocated properly)
            which I did not know how to solve, but when in use, the app doesn't
            use more than 80 Mb of memory which I thought was fine. I do intend
            to come back to this app again and make improvements.
          </p>
          <p>
            This app has no real backend so I made my own JSON and made up some
            dummy data just to have something to download from the server. The
            images for this app are all from Pixabay and Unsplash which are free
            resources and you can check out their licence information here:
            <a href="https://pixabay.com/licence">Pixabay licence</a> and here:
            <a href="https://unsplash.com/licence">Unsplash</a>. Users cannot
            actually purchase these products and the ordering works using
            <a href="https://reqres.in">Reqres</a> service which upon successful
            POST request, returns the request back as is. I needed something to
            accept request and return data back so I can simulate an ordering
            process in the app since there is no real backend.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is my first slightly larger app using SwiftUI, so there were
            some problems, but I made it work and learned some stuff:

          <p>
            I learned so much about SwiftUI building this app and I really like
            this framework. I truly think this is the future of iOS Development.
            Sometimes, dealing with states is tricky, but the way I can build
            views very quickly using SwiftUI is inspiring.
