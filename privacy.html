        <h2>Data collected by third parties</h2>
        <p>
          I built this website with privacy in mind so I am not using any kind
          of analytics software like Google Analytics, Facebook pixels and
          similar. That being said, this website is hosted by GitHub Pages and
          GitHub does collect visitor data as the host of the website. GitHub is
          GDPR compliant and may collect your information for logs of IP
          addresses, to comply with legal obligations and maintain security and
          integrity of their service. Read more about GitHub privacy (Especially
